## Observations and Insights
Looking at the tumor data summary statistics, most of the treatments were very similar to each other in volume mean, except Capomulin and Ramicane. They were significantly smaller then the rest, around 12 to 15 mm3 smaller. That is not the only conncetion Capomulin and Ramicane have in common. As you look at the bar graph for timepoint checks, they had the most timepoints. The rest of the treatments were again around the same value, except Propriva which had less. We will need to investiage to see if their is a connection between the mean volume and the total checks. Looking at the pie chart we can see that it was almost equal in the percent of mouse sex studied. Looking at the line graph for mouse s185, it is clear that Capomulin had some affect on this mouse. But this is one case, we will need to look at more data to make a more solid case.
